# Tkinter is a core Python module but might need separate installation
# on some Linux systems. For Debian/Ubuntu, use:
# sudo apt-get install python3-tk
#
# This file is a placeholder to note such system-level dependencies
# or could be used if other pip-installable packages are added later.
# For example, if a package 'example-package' was needed, you would add:
# example-package==1.0.0
